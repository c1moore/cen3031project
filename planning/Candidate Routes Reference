/candidate/setStatus
	Expects 
		.post(~//candidate/setStatus)
		.send({candidate_id: candidate_id,event_id:'x',status:string 'accepted/invited/volunteer'})

	Changes status to a specific event in the candidate file to accepted or invited or volunteer.  Those are the only choices to change it to.

	If the candidate's accepted field is 'true' then it will change their role to recruiter for the event and their roles.

	If the candidate is not already a user, then it will create a new user with the information from the candidate fields. The default password is their fName + lName.

		
/candidate/setEvent
	Expects 
		.post(~//candidate/setEvent)
		.send({candidate_id: candidate_id,newEvent:{event_id:event_id,accepted: boolean true/false,status:accepted/invited/volunteer'}})

	Adds a new event to the candidate.  Lets you set the accepted and status field manually.  Default for accepted is false and default for status is volunteer.


/candidate/setAccepted
	Expects 
		.post(~//candidate/setAccepted)
		.send({candidate_id: candidate_id,event_id:event_id, accepted:string true/false})

	Changes the accepted field in a specific event for a candidate to boolean true or false. 

	If the candidate's status field is set to 'accepted' then it will change their role to recruiter for the event and their roles.

	If the candidate is not already a user, then it will create a new user with the information from the candidate fields. The default password is their fName + lName.


/candidate/setNote
	Expects 
		.post(~//candidate/setNote)
		.send({candidate_id: candidate_id,note:'string'})_

	Changes the candidate note to string.  Have to be an admin.

/candidate/setCandidate
	Expects 
		.post(~//candidate/setCandidate)
		.send({fName:'string',lName:'string',email:'string@string.string',status:volunteer/invited/accepted, event_id: event_id,accept_Key:true/false,note:'string', user_id:  user_id})

	NOTE: this also works for recruiters/attendees.  It only requires their fName, lName, email, and newEvent.  The rest of the fields will be handled by the backend.  If the other items are included they will be ignored.  (So that an attendee can not set them selves as accepted to be a recruiter for a specific event)

	This is the only candidate route that works for recruites/attendees.  The rest are Admin only.


/candidate/deleteCandidate
	Expects 
		.post(~//candidate/deleteCandidate)
		.send({candidate_id: candidate_id})

	deletes candidate from the database.
