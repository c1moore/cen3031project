			<p>That moment you saw the way forward.  That moment you decided to speak up for someone else.  That moment you became so outraged, you had to take action.  That moment you believed you could make a difference.  At <em>frank</em>2016, we'll celebrate the moments that defined us as changemakers, and we'll create dozens of new ones.</p>
			<p>As we build <em>frank</em>2016, we need your help to find the innovators, movement-builders and rabble rousers whose presence makes <em>frank</em> so special.  We can't do it without your help, so thank you for agreeing to be a recruiter for <em>frank</em>2016.  You're one of just 35 highly networked and sophisticated communicators and changemakers we're trusting to help us recruit the right people to <em>frank</em>2016.  So, who inspires you?  Who do you want to sit with in a coffee shop and take on the problems of the world?</p>
			<p>Last year, 297 people came together for the second gathering of social change communicators.  These changemakers and movement builders have dedicated their lives to ending poverty, shattering gender stereotypes, making the environment safe and healthy, and making sure that every kid gets a chance to learn and grow old.  At <em>frank</em>, they found a community of people eager to share what they've learned about driving social change.</p>
			<p>This email includes step-by-step directions for inviting the people who need to be at frank.  We've also popped a present in the mail to inspire you.</p>
