In case the request.js file in ./node_modules/passport/lib/http/request.js ever gets overwritten by future updates, the following code snippet will have to be added to the end of the file to allow to check user authorization:



/**
* Test if the user has the specified role.
*
* @return {Boolean}
**/
req.hasAuthorization = function(user, roles) {
  return (_.intersection(user.roles, roles).length);
};
